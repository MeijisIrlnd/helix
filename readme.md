<h2>about</h2>
helix is an algorithmic spring reverb, which excels at spring "drip" sounds. it's based around a technique suggested by geraint from [signalsmith](https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/), to emulate the <i>chirp</i> from an authentic spring reverb, involving treating the stft of the feedback signal as a filterbank, and delaying each band by an offset, where said offset increases logarithmically depening on its bin number.<br>
